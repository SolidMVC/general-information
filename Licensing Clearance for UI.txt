LICENSING CLEARANCE FOR UI, THAT ARE RUNNING ON S.O.L.I.D. MVC MICRO-FRAMEWORK IN A WORDPRESS-KERNEL ENVIRONMENT
-------------------
The source code of so-called "HTML templates" (with .php extension), source code of so-called "SQL files (with .php extension)",
JavaScript, CSS, image files, that sits under /UI/ folder of plugin that is running on MIT-licensed SolidMVC micro-framework,
are licensed under commercial-friendly MIT license by default.
                                                  
1. 	If needed, the default MIT license can be overridden by one of copyleft licenses (i.e. AGPL) in open-source projects:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft , as long as original authors credential are left in the file header, if that is a file modification.

2. 	If needed, the default MIT license can be overridden by one of copyright licenses (i.e. CCL) in commercial projects:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright , as long as original authors credential are left in the file header, if that is a file modification.
	
================================================================================================================================================
CLEARANCE ON "NON-DERIVATIVE WORK OF WORDPRESS" FOR FILES INSIDE /UI/ FOLDER:

1.  All UI assets - CSS, image, Javascript file or JavaScript library, so-called "HTML templates" (with .php extension),
    and so-called "SQL files (with .php extension)" are FULLY INDEPENDENT from both - SolidMVC micro-framework and WordPress,
    and can be either moved to another system to work, and take in from another system and loaded in SolidMVC to work.

2.  The views and template loading are unique mechanism to SolidMVC micro-framework, which is MIT open-sourced, and is based on MVC development paradigm.

3.  All UI files that sits in /Views/ folder are NOT derived from WordPress.

4.  Each SolidMVC template variable is bound via SolidMVC controllers-only, then sent to SolidMVC view, that loads exact so-called 'HTML template' (with .php extension)
    for that controller only.

All UI files may be licensed on any license author wants, as long as original MIT header is kept on the top of the file, if that is one of MIT-licensed file modifications.
If some UI file is i.e. AGPL-licensed or uses commercial license, then it should remain as AGPL-licensed or remain commercially licensed respectively.

NOTE FOR UI LICENSING OF EXACT PLUGIN:
For exact plugin licensing please check corresponding folder and license clearance file IN EXACT PLUGIN sub-folder.

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
1.  In SolidMVC coding standard it is defined, that, despite that SolidMVC 'MainController' has a registration for .PO/.MO language files,
    you should only use Unicode CLDR ("Key=>Value" pairs) language coding standard, that does not require your templates, library transpilers, models, views and controllers
    to hook to WordPress core language processing functions.
    Of course, nobody is stopping you from doing that, but then you may lose the licensing independence flexibility from WordPress core license, which is GPL.

2.  The meta header of exact UI file, may be overriding the default /UI/ directory licensing, which in this case is MIT.
