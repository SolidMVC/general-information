1. Let's say we want to add 'Enterprise Rental' demo.

2. Then our demo file header will look like this:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
/**
 * Demo data
 * @package     NS
 * @author      John Native
 * @copyright   John Native
 * @License     See Licensing/README_License.txt for copyright notices and details.
 *
 * @ns-plugin-demo
 * Demo UID: 2
 * Demo Name: Enterprise Rental Demo
 * Enabled: 1
 */
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here, Demo UID - has to be unique, so it has to be different from other demos, and, of course, we set it as visible in admin section by setting:
Enabled: 1

3. We also want to keep our existing demo 'Car Rental Agency' demo available, so we will copy 'demo.SampleAgency.php' file from:
/wp-content/plugins/RentalSystem/UI/Extension1/SQLs/
To:
/wp-content/themes/MyTheme/ExpandableFAQ_UI/Extension1/SQLs/

4. Now we need to make a file for our 'Enterprise Rental' demo. Make sure we are prefixing the demo file with 'demo.' prefix.
So we will copy this file:
/wp-content/themes/MyTheme/ExpandableFAQ_UI/Extension1/SQLs/SampleAgencyCrimsonRedDemoSQL.php
as:
/wp-content/themes/MyTheme/ExpandableFAQ_UI/Extension1/SQLs/EnterpriseRentalDemoSQL.php
and then we will replace that file existing internal header with the one we wrote in this tutorial's step no. 1.

5. We can also put our new car images in Demo Gallery by copying existing folder content:
/wp-content/plugins/RentalSystem/UI/Extension1/DemoGallery/
to folder:
/wp-content/themes/MyTheme/ExpandableFAQ_UI/Extension1/DemoGallery/
And the edit the copied file however we want, or add new car images for our new demo.

6. Now we can edit the 'demo.EnterpriseRental.php' demo file however we want.
Note 1: Instead of exact blog id, we should use supported [BLOG_ID] BB code.
Note 2: For WordPress demo user id, instead of exact user id, we should use supported [WP_DEMO_USER_ID] BB code.
Note 3: For WordPress user meta data table, instead of exact prefix, we should use supported [WP_PREFIX] BB code.
Note 4: Instead of exact plugin version, we should use supported [PLUGIN_VERSION] BB code.
Note 5: Instead of fixed today or yesterday dates, we should use supported [TODAY_TIMESTAMP] and [YESTERDAY_TIMESTAMP] BB codes.
Note 6: For summer season, instead of fixed timestamps, we should use [SUMMER_START_TIMESTAMP] and [SUMMER_END_TIMESTAMP] BB codes.
Note 7: In you want to make your demo based on your current database, please follow instructions in this tutorial:
"Tutorial - How to create an import demo file.txt"

7. To import this new demo to any site, please go to the:
WordPress Admin -> Car Rental -> Settings -> Tab: Import Demo -> Button [Import Demo].

8. That's it - all done.
