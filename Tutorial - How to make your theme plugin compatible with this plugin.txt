This is an example, how the "Steel Blue" CRS CSS stylesheet is made from "Crimson Red" stylesheet.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Let's say we are creating a compatibility for "Avada" Theme (FILE WILL BE NAMED: "compatibility.Avada.css").

2. Create a new folder in our current theme:
"/wp-content/themes/MyTheme/ExpandableFAQ_UI/Extension1/Assets/Front/CSS/"

3. Create a new 'compatibility.Avada.css' file in that folder.

4. Let's open our new CSS file and and update it's metadata information:
/**
 * Additional stylesheet code for compatibility with Avada
 * Theme Name: Avada
 * Author: John Smith
 * Copyright: 2015, John Smith
 * License: Themeforest Split Licence
 */

4.1. Keep in mind that "Theme name" in compatibility file has to match exact
your theme 'style.css' file's meta description line, i.e. "Theme Name: Avada".

5. Write any compatibility CSS you want to our theme.

6. When you will make your theme compatible with our plugin, please let us know by writing an email to - info@nativerental.com - so that we could write that officially in our plugin description, that your theme is compatible with our plugin. And of course we will put a thank you message on the Envato store, that all the world would know who did this great job!
